## Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is Random Number Generation?

  Random Number Generation or RNG is the generation of a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance.

2. What is GINAR?

  GINAR is a random number generator based on Blockchain.

3. Where did the name “GINAR” come from”?

Using the acronym letters from Random Number Generator (RNG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), a randomizer produced the word G.I.N.A.R.

 4. What is GINAR's vision?
 
GINAR’s vision is to provide a truly secure, verifiable, and unpredictable number for multiple applications ranging from security, IOT to gaming and gambling as well as all industries looking for a best-in-class dRNG service.

5. What makes GINAR stand out compared to its competitors?

GINAR provides the advantages that Blockchain offers, but with faster computation, ease of use, and offer higher value at a lower price entry than other similar services.

6. What are the business applications for GINAR?

Business applications exist for companies where the trust of a random number generated needs to be secure at the highest level. The most common examples include Gaming and Gambling, IOT, Banking, Government, and the Security sector.

7. What is the business model?

GINAR will provide services via its application programming interface (API). The first innovative creation of GINAR uses a high-speed pseudo Random Number Generator that is indistinguishable from random and immutable by using Blockchain based ledger. They will provide a zero-house edge decentralized solution for real world applications in B2B premises that is set to kick start the service with a trustless crowd sale. This will be the breakthrough in the future of gambling, banking and other markets.

8. What are payment types?

Subscription-based scheme

9. How can the prototype be tested?

Currently we have conducted statistical tests using the NIST SP 800-22 suite to examine the distribution of generated numbers to tell how "random" they are. This test suite is acknowledged as an industry standard.

10. What are GINAR’s design principles?

Unpredictability, Verifiability, Tamper Resistance, Open participation, High Performance, Security, and must be Cost effective.
